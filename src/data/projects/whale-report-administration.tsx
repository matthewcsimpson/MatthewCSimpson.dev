  `Ocean Wise is a major conservation non-profit that has multiple programs in place to help protect the world's oceans and the life that lives within them. The Whale Report Alert System (WRAS) is a program designed to alert mariners to the presence of whales in shipping lanes with the end goal of reducing whale strikes, of which there are as many as 20,000 every year. The system accepts data from automated systems as well as from users on the water.`,
  `Ocean Wise contracted Skyrocket Digital to build an administration panel for this program. Created as a module of their broader web platform. As the primary contributor I built the screens and interactions for this module which allow administrator users to interact with and make changes to submitted whale sightings. Administrators are able to change many of the sighting details, including their status. This allows them to verify sightings, and remove sightings from public view that may not meet the criteria to be a valid sighting.`,
  `The admin panel interacts with the same back end that powers the Whale Report Alert System itself to allow these changes.`,

  `### Challenges & Post Launch

The primary challenge for this admin panel is the specificity. This application has few users, but those users require a high level of detail as well as a fine level of control over what they are doing. The smallest of changes has a large impact, and I worked closely with the stakeholders to make sure that their feedback was heard and applied quickly and carefully.`,

  `The Whale Report Administration panel has been live for several months now and is actively being used by Ocean Wise staff to manage whale sightings. The feedback has been positive, and the system is helping Ocean Wise to better manage and protect whale populations.`,
