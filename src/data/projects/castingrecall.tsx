  `Can you guess the movie based on the cast? That's the hook of _Casting ReCall_. 
The game presents you with the top-line cast list from six films, and from those cast lists, you guess the films.`,

  `You have ten guesses to get all six. The puzzle generation is automated, and there is a pattern to them that could help you guess the movies. See if you can spot it!`,

  `### Development
  
  Casting ReCall is a full-stack app using a React front end with Sass and React Router, with a Node/Express/PostgreSQL back end. The game was originally conceived for my capstone project during my time at BrainStation.  I had always planned to deploy it, but it took me two years to come back to the project.`,

  `I  spent the time to update to the latest version of React, to include some best practices, and add some missing pieces. Sticking with React and JavaScript instead of updating to something like Next and TypeScript felt like a better choice (and a good skill refresh).`,

  `Both the front and back end of the projects are deployed via Heroku, along with Heroku Postgres for data storage and Heroku Scheduler for daily puzzle generation.`,
