  `Ocean Wise is a major conservation non-profit that has multiple programs in place to help protect the world's oceans and the life that lives within them. The Whale Report Alert System (WRAS) is a program designed to alert mariners to the presence of whales in shipping lanes with the end goal of reducing whale strikes, of which there are as many as 20,000 every year. The system accepts data from automated systems as well as from users on the water.`,
  `Ocean Wise contracted Skyrocket Digital to upgrade their legacy system to a new, modern, multiplatform system and in 2024 I became the primary contributor for the web front end, which is integrated into app.ocean.org, the web platform we also modernized for them.`,
  `The system displays whale sighting data from several sources as well as accepts whale sightings from both everyday users and mariners. Users get different UI options depending on what user type they are, the former receiving time-delayed updates and the latter receiving updates in real time.`,
  `The system is designed using a responsive, mobile-first approach. Through this program I also refactored core components of the web platform for increased readability, maintainability, and performance.`,
