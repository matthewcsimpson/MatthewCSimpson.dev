  `Code4rena (C4) is a competitive audit and bounty platform where security researchers (referred to as Wardens) review, audit, and analyse codebases for security vulnerabilities in exchange for bounties provided by sponsoring projects.

As a member of the [Stack Five](https://stackfive.io) team, I was embedded in Code4rena's engineering team working primarily on front-end pages and components, but also backend functionality, on their web platform <https://code4rena.com/>.

In addition to the web front end there was also a bespoke NPM module for commonly reused components and functions, and an admin tool for judges to review submitted audits by wardens.

This project also included one of my favourite experiences as a developer: for approximately two months I was given free rein on the backlog of submitted issues, bugs, and updates, and was able to reduce the list from well over one hundred tasks to under twenty. These tasks ranged from simple bug fixes to complex CSS and logic problems.

## Challenges

The primary challenges for this project were the distributed team, which was worldwide. We solved this with communication via Slack and email. One of my team members was located on the other side of the planet, meaning we could hand work off to one another and create an almost constant cadence.

The other was integrating all of the client's projects, and maintaining two separate UIs, one for logged-in users and one for everyone else, which we did by implementing modern SCSS.
